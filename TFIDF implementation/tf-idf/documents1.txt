replace words in english, we have a concept called root, which can be followed by some other word to form another longer word - let's call this word successor. for example, when the root "an" is followed by the successor word "other", we can form a new word "another". given a dictionary consisting of many roots and a sentence consisting of words separated by spaces, replace all the successors in the sentence with the root forming it. if a successor can be replaced by more than one root, replace it with the root that has the shortest length. return the sentence after the replacement.
remove all adjacent duplicates in string ii you are given a string s and an integer k, a k duplicate removal consists of choosing k adjacent and equal letters from s and removing them, causing the left and the right side of the deleted substring to concatenate together. we repeatedly make k duplicate removals on s until we no longer can. return the final string after all such duplicate removals have been made. it is guaranteed that the answer is unique.
longest path with different adjacent characters you are given a tree (i.e. a connected, undirected graph that has no cycles) rooted at node 0 consisting of n nodes numbered from 0 to n - 1. the tree is represented by a 0-indexed array parent of size n, where parent[i] is the parent of node i. since node 0 is the root, parent[0] == -1. you are also given a string s of length n, where s[i] is the character assigned to node i. return the length of the longest path in the tree such that no pair of adjacent nodes on the path have the same character assigned to them.
roman to integer roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: i, v, x, l, c, d and m. symbol value i 1 v 5 x 10 l 50 c 100 d 500 m 1000 for example, 2 is written as ii in roman numeral, just two ones added together. 12 is written as xii, which is simply x + ii. the number 27 is written as xxvii, which is xx + v + ii. roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. however, the numeral for four is not iiii. instead, the number four is written as iv. because the one is before the five we subtract it making four. the same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as ix. there are six instances where subtraction is used: i can be placed before v (5) and x (10) to make 4 and 9. x can be placed before l (50) and c (100) to make 40 and 90. c can be placed before d (500) and m (1000) to make 400 and 900. given a roman numeral, convert it to an integer.

decode ways a message containing letters from a-z can be encoded into numbers using the following mapping: 'a' -> "1" 'b' -> "2" ... 'z' -> "26" to decode an encoded message, all the digits must be grouped then mapped back into letters using the reverse of the mapping above (there may be multiple ways). for example, "11106" can be mapped into: "aajf" with the grouping (1 1 10 6) "kjf" with the grouping (11 10 6) note that the grouping (1 11 06) is invalid because "06" cannot be mapped into 'f' since "6" is different from "06". given a string s containing only digits, return the number of ways to decode it. the test cases are generated so that the answer fits in a 32-bit integer.
rotate image you are given an n x n 2d matrix representing an image, rotate the image by 90 degrees (clockwise). you have to rotate the image in-place, which means you have to modify the input 2d matrix directly. do not allocate another 2d matrix and do the rotation.

construct quad tree given a n * n matrix grid of 0's and 1's only. we want to represent grid with a quad-tree. return the root of the quad-tree representing grid. a quad-tree is a tree data structure in which each internal node has exactly four children. besides, each node has two attributes: val: true if the node represents a grid of 1's or false if the node represents a grid of 0's. notice that you can assign the val to true or false when isleaf is false, and both are accepted in the answer. isleaf: true if the node is a leaf node on the tree or false if the node has four children. class node { public boolean val; public boolean isleaf; public node topleft; public node topright; public node bottomleft; public node bottomright; } we can construct a quad-tree from a two-dimensional area using the following steps: if the current grid has the same value (i.e all 1's or all 0's) set isleaf true and set val to the value of the grid and set the four children to null and stop. if the current grid has different values, set isleaf to false and set val to any value and divide the current grid into four sub-grids as shown in the photo. recurse for each of the children with the proper sub-grid. if you want to know more about the quad-tree, you can refer to the wiki. quad-tree format: you don't need to read this section for solving the problem. this is only if you want to understand the output format here. the output represents the serialized format of a quad-tree using level order traversal, where null signifies a path terminator where no node exists below. it is very similar to the serialization of the binary tree. the only difference is that the node is represented as a list [isleaf, val]. if the value of isleaf or val is true we represent it as 1 in the list [isleaf, val] and if the value of isleaf or val is false we represent it as 0.
minimum window substring given two strings s and t of lengths m and n respectively, return the minimum window substring of s such that every character in t (including duplicates) is included in the window. if there is no such substring, return the empty string "". the testcases will be generated such that the answer is unique.

average time of process per machine sql schema table: activity +----------------+---------+ | column name | type | +----------------+---------+ | machine_id | int | | process_id | int | | activity_type | enum | | timestamp | float | +----------------+---------+ the table shows the user activities for a factory website. (machine_id, process_id, activity_type) is the primary key of this table. machine_id is the id of a machine. process_id is the id of a process running on the machine with id machine_id. activity_type is an enum of type ('start', 'end'). timestamp is a float representing the current time in seconds. 'start' means the machine starts the process at the given timestamp and 'end' means the machine ends the process at the given timestamp. the 'start' timestamp will always be before the 'end' timestamp for every (machine_id, process_id) pair. there is a factory website that has several machines each running the same number of processes. write an sql query to find the average time each machine takes to complete a process. the time to complete a process is the 'end' timestamp minus the 'start' timestamp. the average time is calculated by the total time to complete every process on the machine divided by the number of processes that were run. the resulting table should have the machine_id along with the average time as processing_time, which should be rounded to 3 decimal places. return the result table in any order. the query result format is in the following example.

binary tree coloring game two players play a turn based game on a binary tree. we are given the root of this binary tree, and the number of nodes n in the tree. n is odd, and each node has a distinct value from 1 to n. initially, the first player names a value x with 1 <= x <= n, and the second player names a value y with 1 <= y <= n and y != x. the first player colors the node with value x red, and the second player colors the node with value y blue. then, the players take turns starting with the first player. in each turn, that player chooses a node of their color (red if player 1, blue if player 2) and colors an uncolored neighbor of the chosen node (either the left child, right child, or parent of the chosen node.) if (and only if) a player cannot choose such a node in this way, they must pass their turn. if both players pass their turn, the game ends, and the winner is the player that colored more nodes. you are the second player. if it is possible to choose such a y to ensure you win the game, return true. if it is not possible, return false.
distribute candies to people we distribute some number of candies, to a row of n = num_people people in the following way: we then give 1 candy to the first person, 2 candies to the second person, and so on until we give n candies to the last person. then, we go back to the start of the row, giving n + 1 candies to the first person, n + 2 candies to the second person, and so on until we give 2 * n candies to the last person. this process repeats (with us giving one more candy each time, and moving to the start of the row after we reach the end) until we run out of candies. the last person will receive all of our remaining candies (not necessarily one more than the previous gift). return an array (of length num_people and sum candies) that represents the final distribution of candies.
scramble string we can scramble a string s to get a string t using the following algorithm: if the length of the string is 1, stop. if the length of the string is > 1, do the following: split the string into two non-empty substrings at a random index, i.e., if the string is s, divide it to x and y where s = x + y. randomly decide to swap the two substrings or to keep them in the same order. i.e., after this step, s may become s = x + y or s = y + x. apply step 1 recursively on each of the two substrings x and y. given two strings s1 and s2 of the same length, return true if s2 is a scrambled string of s1, otherwise, return false.

(i.e., "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not.
divide a string into groups of size k a string s can be partitioned into groups of size k using the following procedure: the first group consists of the first k characters of the string, the second group consists of the next k characters of the string, and so on. each character can be a part of exactly one group. for the last group, if the string does not have k characters remaining, a character fill is used to complete the group. note that the partition is done so that after removing the fill character from the last group (if it exists) and concatenating all the groups in order, the resultant string should be s. given the string s, the size of each group k and the character fill, return a string array denoting the composition of every group s has been divided into, using the above procedure.

shifting letters you are given a string s of lowercase english letters and an integer array shifts of the same length. call the shift() of a letter, the next letter in the alphabet, (wrapping around so that 'z' becomes 'a'). for example, shift('a') = 'b', shift('t') = 'u', and shift('z') = 'a'. now for each shifts[i] = x, we want to shift the first i + 1 letters of s, x times. return the final string after all such shifts to s are applied.
finding mk average you are given two integers, m and k, and a stream of integers. you are tasked to implement a data structure that calculates the mkaverage for the stream. the mkaverage can be calculated using these steps: if the number of the elements in the stream is less than m you should consider the mkaverage to be -1. otherwise, copy the last m elements of the stream to a separate container. remove the smallest k elements and the largest k elements from the container. calculate the average value for the rest of the elements rounded down to the nearest integer. implement the mkaverage class: mkaverage(int m, int k) initializes the mkaverage object with an empty stream and the two integers m and k. void addelement(int num) inserts a new element num into the stream. int calculatemkaverage() calculates and returns the mkaverage for the current stream rounded down to the nearest integer.

binary tree preorder traversal given the root of a binary tree, return the preorder traversal of its nodes' values.
similar string groups two strings, x and y, are considered similar if either they are identical or we can make them equivalent by swapping at most two letters (in distinct positions) within the string x. for example, "tars" and "rats" are similar (swapping at positions 0 and 2), and "rats" and "arts" are similar, but "star" is not similar to "tars", "rats", or "arts". together, these form two connected groups by similarity: {"tars", "rats", "arts"} and {"star"}. notice that "tars" and "arts" are in the same group even though they are not similar. formally, each group is such that a word is in the group if and only if it is similar to at least one other word in the group. we are given a list strs of strings where every string in strs is an anagram of every other string in strs. how many groups are there?

cat and mouse a game on an undirected graph is played by two players, mouse and cat, who alternate turns. the graph is given as follows: graph[a] is a list of all nodes b such that ab is an edge of the graph. the mouse starts at node 1 and goes first, the cat starts at node 2 and goes second, and there is a hole at node 0. during each player's turn, they must travel along one edge of the graph that meets where they are. for example, if the mouse is at node 1, it must travel to any node in graph[1]. additionally, it is not allowed for the cat to travel to the hole (node 0.) then, the game can end in three ways: if ever the cat occupies the same node as the mouse, the cat wins. if ever the mouse reaches the hole, the mouse wins. if ever a position is repeated (i.e., the players are in the same position as a previous turn, and it is the same player's turn to move), the game is a draw. given a graph, and assuming both players play optimally, return 1 if the mouse wins the game, 2 if the cat wins the game, or 0 if the game is a draw.
create sorted array through instructions given an integer array instructions, you are asked to create a sorted array from the elements in instructions. you start with an empty container nums. for each element from left to right in instructions, insert it into nums. the cost of each insertion is the minimum of the following: the number of elements currently in nums that are strictly less than instructions[i]. the number of elements currently in nums that are strictly greater than instructions[i]. for example, if inserting element 3 into nums = [1,2,3,5], the cost of insertion is min(2, 1) (elements 1 and 2 are less than 3, element 5 is greater than 3) and nums will become [1,2,3,3,5]. return the total cost to insert all elements from instructions into nums. since the answer may be large, return it modulo 109 + 7

equal rational numbers given two strings s and t, each of which represents a non-negative rational number, return true if and only if they represent the same number. the strings may use parentheses to denote the repeating part of the rational number. a rational number can be represented using up to three parts: <integerpart>, <nonrepeatingpart>, and a <repeatingpart>. the number will be represented in one of the following three ways: <integerpart> for example, 12, 0, and 123. <integerpart><.><nonrepeatingpart> for example, 0.5, 1., 2.12, and 123.0001. <integerpart><.><nonrepeatingpart><(><repeatingpart><)> for example, 0.1(6), 1.(9), 123.00(1212). the repeating portion of a decimal expansion is conventionally denoted within a pair of round brackets. for example: 1/6 = 0.16666666... = 0.1(6) = 0.1666(6) = 0.166(66).
largest time for given digits given an array arr of 4 digits, find the latest 24-hour time that can be made using each digit exactly once. 24-hour times are formatted as "hh:mm", where hh is between 00 and 23, and mm is between 00 and 59. the earliest 24-hour time is 00:00, and the latest is 23:59. return the latest 24-hour time in "hh:mm" format. if no valid time can be made, return an empty string.
split the array to make coprime products you are given a 0-indexed integer array nums of length n. a split at an index i where 0 <= i <= n - 2 is called valid if the product of the first i + 1 elements and the product of the remaining elements are coprime. for example, if nums = [2, 3, 3], then a split at the index i = 0 is valid because 2 and 9 are coprime, while a split at the index i = 1 is not valid because 6 and 3 are not coprime. a split at the index i = 2 is not valid because i == n - 1. return the smallest index i at which the array can be split validly or -1 if there is no such split. two values val1 and val2 are coprime if gcd(val1, val2) == 1 where gcd(val1, val2) is the greatest common divisor of val1 and val2.
sliding window median the median is the middle value in an ordered integer list. if the size of the list is even, there is no middle value. so the median is the mean of the two middle values. for examples, if arr = [2,3,4], the median is 3. for examples, if arr = [1,2,3,4], the median is (2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5. you are given an integer array nums and an integer k. there is a sliding window of size k which is moving from the very left of the array to the very right. you can only see the k numbers in the window. each time the sliding window moves right by one position. return the median array for each window in the original array. answers within 10-5 of the actual value will be accepted.

encode and decode tinyurl note: this is a companion problem to the system design problem: design tinyurl. tinyurl is a url shortening service where you enter a url such as https://leetcode.com/problems/design-tinyurl and it returns a short url such as http://tinyurl.com/4e9iak. design a class to encode a url and decode a tiny url. there is no restriction on how your encode/decode algorithm should work. you just need to ensure that a url can be encoded to a tiny url and the tiny url can be decoded to the original url. implement the solution class: solution() initializes the object of the system. string encode(string longurl) returns a tiny url for the given longurl. string decode(string shorturl) returns the original long url for the given shorturl. it is guaranteed that the given shorturl was encoded by the same object.
binary prefix divisible by 5 you are given a binary array nums (0-indexed). we define xi as the number whose binary representation is the subarray nums[0..i] (from most-significant-bit to least-significant-bit). for example, if nums = [1,0,1], then x0 = 1, x1 = 2, and x2 = 5. return an array of booleans answer where answer[i] is true if xi is divisible by 5.

find the middle index in array given a 0-indexed integer array nums, find the leftmost middleindex (i.e., the smallest amongst all the possible ones). a middleindex is an index where nums[0] + nums[1] + ... + nums[middleindex-1] == nums[middleindex+1] + nums[middleindex+2] + ... + nums[nums.length-1]. if middleindex == 0, the left side sum is considered to be 0. similarly, if middleindex == nums.length - 1, the right side sum is considered to be 0. return the leftmost middleindex that satisfies the condition, or -1 if there is no such index.
optimal partition of string given a string s, partition the string into one or more substrings such that the characters in each substring are unique. that is, no letter appears in a single substring more than once. return the minimum number of substrings in such a partition. note that each character should belong to exactly one substring in a partition.
least operators to express number given a single positive integer x, we will write an expression of the form x (op1) x (op2) x (op3) x ... where each operator op1, op2, etc. is either addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division (+, -, *, or /). for example, with x = 3, we might write 3 * 3 / 3 + 3 - 3 which is a value of 3. when writing such an expression, we adhere to the following conventions: the division operator (/) returns rational numbers. there are no parentheses placed anywhere. we use the usual order of operations: multiplication and division happen before addition and subtraction. it is not allowed to use the unary negation operator (-). for example, "x - x" is a valid expression as it only uses subtraction, but "-x + x" is not because it uses negation. we would like to write an expression with the least number of operators such that the expression equals the given target. return the least number of operators used.
merge sorted array you are given two integer arrays nums1 and nums2, sorted in non-decreasing order, and two integers m and n, representing the number of elements in nums1 and nums2 respectively. merge nums1 and nums2 into a single array sorted in non-decreasing order. the final sorted array should not be returned by the function, but instead be stored inside the array nums1. to accommodate this, nums1 has a length of m + n, where the first m elements denote the elements that should be merged, and the last n elements are set to 0 and should be ignored. nums2 has a length of n.
largest multiple of three given an array of digits digits, return the largest multiple of three that can be formed by concatenating some of the given digits in any order. if there is no answer return an empty string. since the answer may not fit in an integer data type, return the answer as a string. note that the returning answer must not contain unnecessary leading zeros.
sell diminishing-valued colored balls you have an inventory of different colored balls, and there is a customer that wants orders balls of any color. the customer weirdly values the colored balls. each colored ball's value is the number of balls of that color you currently have in your inventory. for example, if you own 6 yellow balls, the customer would pay 6 for the first yellow ball. after the transaction, there are only 5 yellow balls left, so the next yellow ball is then valued at 5 (i.e., the value of the balls decreases as you sell more to the customer). you are given an integer array, inventory, where inventory[i] represents the number of balls of the ith color that you initially own. you are also given an integer orders, which represents the total number of balls that the customer wants. you can sell the balls in any order. return the maximum total value that you can attain after selling orders colored balls. as the answer may be too large, return it modulo 109 + 7.
put marbles in bags you have k bags. you are given a 0-indexed integer array weights where weights[i] is the weight of the ith marble. you are also given the integer k. divide the marbles into the k bags according to the following rules: no bag is empty. if the ith marble and jth marble are in a bag, then all marbles with an index between the ith and jth indices should also be in that same bag. if a bag consists of all the marbles with an index from i to j inclusively, then the cost of the bag is weights[i] + weights[j]. the score after distributing the marbles is the sum of the costs of all the k bags. return the difference between the maximum and minimum scores among marble distributions.

champagne tower we stack glasses in a pyramid, where the first row has 1 glass, the second row has 2 glasses, and so on until the 100th row. each glass holds one cup of champagne. then, some champagne is poured into the first glass at the top. when the topmost glass is full, any excess liquid poured will fall equally to the glass immediately to the left and right of it. when those glasses become full, any excess champagne will fall equally to the left and right of those glasses, and so on. (a glass at the bottom row has its excess champagne fall on the floor.) for example, after one cup of champagne is poured, the top most glass is full. after two cups of champagne are poured, the two glasses on the second row are half full. after three cups of champagne are poured, those two cups become full - there are 3 full glasses total now. after four cups of champagne are poured, the third row has the middle glass half full, and the two outside glasses are a quarter full, as pictured below. now after pouring some non-negative integer cups of champagne, return how full the jth glass in the ith row is (both i and j are 0-indexed.)

lfu cache design and implement a data structure for a least frequently used (lfu) cache. implement the lfucache class: lfucache(int capacity) initializes the object with the capacity of the data structure. int get(int key) gets the value of the key if the key exists in the cache. otherwise, returns -1. void put(int key, int value) update the value of the key if present, or inserts the key if not already present. when the cache reaches its capacity, it should invalidate and remove the least frequently used key before inserting a new item. for this problem, when there is a tie (i.e., two or more keys with the same frequency), the least recently used key would be invalidated. to determine the least frequently used key, a use counter is maintained for each key in the cache. the key with the smallest use counter is the least frequently used key. when a key is first inserted into the cache, its use counter is set to 1 (due to the put operation). the use counter for a key in the cache is incremented either a get or put operation is called on it. the functions get and put must each run in o(1) average time complexity.

remove comments given a c++ program, remove comments from it. the program source is an array of strings source where source[i] is the ith line of the source code. this represents the result of splitting the original source code string by the newline character '\n'. in c++, there are two types of comments, line comments, and block comments. the string "//" denotes a line comment, which represents that it and the rest of the characters to the right of it in the same line should be ignored. the string "/*" denotes a block comment, which represents that all characters until the next (non-overlapping) occurrence of "*/" should be ignored. (here, occurrences happen in reading order: line by line from left to right.) to be clear, the string "/*/" does not yet end the block comment, as the ending would be overlapping the beginning. the first effective comment takes precedence over others. for example, if the string "//" occurs in a block comment, it is ignored. similarly, if the string "/*" occurs in a line or block comment, it is also ignored. if a certain line of code is empty after removing comments, you must not output that line: each string in the answer list will be non-empty. there will be no control characters, single quote, or double quote characters. for example, source = "string s = "/* not a comment. */";" will not be a test case. also, nothing else such as defines or macros will interfere with the comments. it is guaranteed that every open block comment will eventually be closed, so "/*" outside of a line or block comment always starts a new comment. finally, implicit newline characters can be deleted by block comments. please see the examples below for details. after removing the comments from the source code, return the source code in the same format.
remove letter to equalize frequency you are given a 0-indexed string word, consisting of lowercase english letters. you need to select one index and remove the letter at that index from word so that the frequency of every letter present in word is equal. return true if it is possible to remove one letter so that the frequency of all letters in word are equal, and false otherwise. note: the frequency of a letter x is the number of times it occurs in the string. you must remove exactly one letter and cannot chose to do nothing.
rle iterator we can use run-length encoding (i.e., rle) to encode a sequence of integers. in a run-length encoded array of even length encoding (0-indexed), for all even i, encoding[i] tells us the number of times that the non-negative integer value encoding[i + 1] is repeated in the sequence. for example, the sequence arr = [8,8,8,5,5] can be encoded to be encoding = [3,8,2,5]. encoding = [3,8,0,9,2,5] and encoding = [2,8,1,8,2,5] are also valid rle of arr. given a run-length encoded array, design an iterator that iterates through it. implement the rleiterator class: rleiterator(int[] encoded) initializes the object with the encoded array encoded. int next(int n) exhausts the next n elements and returns the last element exhausted in this way. if there is no element left to exhaust, return -1 instead.

throne inheritance a kingdom consists of a king, his children, his grandchildren, and so on. every once in a while, someone in the family dies or a child is born. the kingdom has a well-defined order of inheritance that consists of the king as the first member. let's define the recursive function successor(x, curorder), which given a person x and the inheritance order so far, returns who should be the next person after x in the order of inheritance. successor(x, curorder): if x has no children or all of x's children are in curorder: if x is the king return null else return successor(x's parent, curorder) else return x's oldest child who's not in curorder for example, assume we have a kingdom that consists of the king, his children alice and bob (alice is older than bob), and finally alice's son jack. in the beginning, curorder will be ["king"]. calling successor(king, curorder) will return alice, so we append to curorder to get ["king", "alice"]. calling successor(alice, curorder) will return jack, so we append to curorder to get ["king", "alice", "jack"]. calling successor(jack, curorder) will return bob, so we append to curorder to get ["king", "alice", "jack", "bob"]. calling successor(bob, curorder) will return null. thus the order of inheritance will be ["king", "alice", "jack", "bob"]. using the above function, we can always obtain a unique order of inheritance. implement the throneinheritance class: throneinheritance(string kingname) initializes an object of the throneinheritance class. the name of the king is given as part of the constructor. void birth(string parentname, string childname) indicates that parentname gave birth to childname. void death(string name) indicates the death of name. the death of the person doesn't affect the successor function nor the current inheritance order. you can treat it as just marking the person as dead. string[] getinheritanceorder() returns a list representing the current order of inheritance excluding dead people.
online election you are given two integer arrays persons and times. in an election, the ith vote was cast for persons[i] at time times[i]. for each query at a time t, find the person that was leading the election at time t. votes cast at time t will count towards our query. in the case of a tie, the most recent vote (among tied candidates) wins. implement the topvotedcandidate class: topvotedcandidate(int[] persons, int[] times) initializes the object with the persons and times arrays. int q(int t) returns the number of the person that was leading the election at time t according to the mentioned rules.

maximize number of nice divisors you are given a positive integer primefactors. you are asked to construct a positive integer n that satisfies the following conditions: the number of prime factors of n (not necessarily distinct) is at most primefactors. the number of nice divisors of n is maximized. note that a divisor of n is nice if it is divisible by every prime factor of n. for example, if n = 12, then its prime factors are [2,2,3], then 6 and 12 are nice divisors, while 3 and 4 are not. return the number of nice divisors of n. since that number can be too large, return it modulo 109 + 7. note that a prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that is not a product of two smaller natural numbers. the prime factors of a number n is a list of prime numbers such that their product equals n.
minimum cost to set cooking time a generic microwave supports cooking times for: at least 1 second. at most 99 minutes and 99 seconds. to set the cooking time, you push at most four digits. the microwave normalizes what you push as four digits by prepending zeroes. it interprets the first two digits as the minutes and the last two digits as the seconds. it then adds them up as the cooking time. for example, you push 9 5 4 (three digits). it is normalized as 0954 and interpreted as 9 minutes and 54 seconds. you push 0 0 0 8 (four digits). it is interpreted as 0 minutes and 8 seconds. you push 8 0 9 0. it is interpreted as 80 minutes and 90 seconds. you push 8 1 3 0. it is interpreted as 81 minutes and 30 seconds. you are given integers startat, movecost, pushcost, and targetseconds. initially, your finger is on the digit startat. moving the finger above any specific digit costs movecost units of fatigue. pushing the digit below the finger once costs pushcost units of fatigue. there can be multiple ways to set the microwave to cook for targetseconds seconds but you are interested in the way with the minimum cost. return the minimum cost to set targetseconds seconds of cooking time. remember that one minute consists of 60 seconds.
online stock span design an algorithm that collects daily price quotes for some stock and returns the span of that stock's price for the current day. the span of the stock's price in one day is the maximum number of consecutive days (starting from that day and going backward) for which the stock price was less than or equal to the price of that day. for example, if the prices of the stock in the last four days is [7,2,1,2] and the price of the stock today is 2, then the span of today is 4 because starting from today, the price of the stock was less than or equal 2 for 4 consecutive days. also, if the prices of the stock in the last four days is [7,34,1,2] and the price of the stock today is 8, then the span of today is 3 because starting from today, the price of the stock was less than or equal 8 for 3 consecutive days. implement the stockspanner class: stockspanner() initializes the object of the class. int next(int price) returns the span of the stock's price given that today's price is price.

maximum nesting depth of two valid parentheses strings a string is a valid parentheses string (denoted vps) if and only if it consists of "(" and ")" characters only, and: it is the empty string, or it can be written as ab (a concatenated with b), where a and b are vps's, or it can be written as (a), where a is a vps. we can similarly define the nesting depth depth(s) of any vps s as follows: depth("") = 0 depth(a + b) = max(depth(a), depth(b)), where a and b are vps's depth("(" + a + ")") = 1 + depth(a), where a is a vps. for example, "", "()()", and "()(()())" are vps's (with nesting depths 0, 1, and 2), and ")(" and "(()" are not vps's. given a vps seq, split it into two disjoint subsequences a and b, such that a and b are vps's (and a.length + b.length = seq.length). now choose any such a and b such that max(depth(a), depth(b)) is the minimum possible value. return an answer array (of length seq.length) that encodes such a choice of a and b: answer[i] = 0 if seq[i] is part of a, else answer[i] = 1. note that even though multiple answers may exist, you may return any of them.

clumsy factorial the factorial of a positive integer n is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n. for example, factorial(10) = 10 * 9 * 8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1. we make a clumsy factorial using the integers in decreasing order by swapping out the multiply operations for a fixed rotation of operations with multiply '*', divide '/', add '+', and subtract '-' in this order. for example, clumsy(10) = 10 * 9 / 8 + 7 - 6 * 5 / 4 + 3 - 2 * 1. however, these operations are still applied using the usual order of operations of arithmetic. we do all multiplication and division steps before any addition or subtraction steps, and multiplication and division steps are processed left to right. additionally, the division that we use is floor division such that 10 * 9 / 8 = 90 / 8 = 11. given an integer n, return the clumsy factorial of n.

maximum points in an archery competition alice and bob are opponents in an archery competition. the competition has set the following rules: alice first shoots numarrows arrows and then bob shoots numarrows arrows. the points are then calculated as follows: the target has integer scoring sections ranging from 0 to 11 inclusive. for each section of the target with score k (in between 0 to 11), say alice and bob have shot ak and bk arrows on that section respectively. if ak >= bk, then alice takes k points. if ak < bk, then bob takes k points. however, if ak == bk == 0, then nobody takes k points. for example, if alice and bob both shot 2 arrows on the section with score 11, then alice takes 11 points. on the other hand, if alice shot 0 arrows on the section with score 11 and bob shot 2 arrows on that same section, then bob takes 11 points. you are given the integer numarrows and an integer array alicearrows of size 12, which represents the number of arrows alice shot on each scoring section from 0 to 11. now, bob wants to maximize the total number of points he can obtain. return the array bobarrows which represents the number of arrows bob shot on each scoring section from 0 to 11. the sum of the values in bobarrows should equal numarrows. if there are multiple ways for bob to earn the maximum total points, return any one of them.

clumsy factorial the factorial of a positive integer n is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n. for example, factorial(10) = 10 * 9 * 8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1. we make a clumsy factorial using the integers in decreasing order by swapping out the multiply operations for a fixed rotation of operations with multiply '*', divide '/', add '+', and subtract '-' in this order. for example, clumsy(10) = 10 * 9 / 8 + 7 - 6 * 5 / 4 + 3 - 2 * 1. however, these operations are still applied using the usual order of operations of arithmetic. we do all multiplication and division steps before any addition or subtraction steps, and multiplication and division steps are processed left to right. additionally, the division that we use is floor division such that 10 * 9 / 8 = 90 / 8 = 11. given an integer n, return the clumsy factorial of n.

decode ways ii a message containing letters from a-z can be encoded into numbers using the following mapping: 'a' -> "1" 'b' -> "2" ... 'z' -> "26" to decode an encoded message, all the digits must be grouped then mapped back into letters using the reverse of the mapping above (there may be multiple ways). for example, "11106" can be mapped into: "aajf" with the grouping (1 1 10 6) "kjf" with the grouping (11 10 6) note that the grouping (1 11 06) is invalid because "06" cannot be mapped into 'f' since "6" is different from "06". in addition to the mapping above, an encoded message may contain the '*' character, which can represent any digit from '1' to '9' ('0' is excluded). for example, the encoded message "1*" may represent any of the encoded messages "11", "12", "13", "14", "15", "16", "17", "18", or "19". decoding "1*" is equivalent to decoding any of the encoded messages it can represent. given a string s consisting of digits and '*' characters, return the number of ways to decode it. since the answer may be very large, return it modulo 109 + 7.

valid tic-tac-toe state given a tic-tac-toe board as a string array board, return true if and only if it is possible to reach this board position during the course of a valid tic-tac-toe game. the board is a 3 x 3 array that consists of characters ' ', 'x', and 'o'. the ' ' character represents an empty square. here are the rules of tic-tac-toe: players take turns placing characters into empty squares ' '. the first player always places 'x' characters, while the second player always places 'o' characters. 'x' and 'o' characters are always placed into empty squares, never filled ones. the game ends when there are three of the same (non-empty) character filling any row, column, or diagonal. the game also ends if all squares are non-empty. no more moves can be played if the game is over.
delete columns to make sorted iii you are given an array of n strings strs, all of the same length. we may choose any deletion indices, and we delete all the characters in those indices for each string. for example, if we have strs = ["abcdef","uvwxyz"] and deletion indices {0, 2, 3}, then the final array after deletions is ["bef", "vyz"]. suppose we chose a set of deletion indices answer such that after deletions, the final array has every string (row) in lexicographic order. (i.e., (strs[0][0] <= strs[0][1] <= ... <= strs[0][strs[0].length - 1]), and (strs[1][0] <= strs[1][1] <= ... <= strs[1][strs[1].length - 1]), and so on). return the minimum possible value of answer.length.

(i.e., [1,3,5] is a subsequence of [1,2,3,4,5] while [1,3,2] is not).

throttle given a function fn and a time in milliseconds t, return a throttled version of that function. a throttled function is first called without delay and then, for a time interval of t milliseconds, can't be executed but should store the latest function arguments provided to call fn with them after the end of the delay. for instance, t = 50ms, and the function was called at 30ms, 40ms, and 60ms. the first function call would block calling functions for the following t milliseconds. the second function call would save arguments, and the third call arguments should overwrite currently stored arguments from the second call because the second and third calls are called before 80ms. once the delay has passed, the throttled function should be called with the latest arguments provided during the delay period, and it should also create another delay period of 80ms + t. the above diagram shows how throttle will transform events. each rectangle represents 100ms and the throttle time is 400ms. each color represents a different set of inputs.

parse lisp expression you are given a string expression representing a lisp-like expression to return the integer value of. the syntax for these expressions is given as follows. an expression is either an integer, let expression, add expression, mult expression, or an assigned variable. expressions always evaluate to a single integer. (an integer could be positive or negative.) a let expression takes the form "(let v1 e1 v2 e2 ... vn en expr)", where let is always the string "let", then there are one or more pairs of alternating variables and expressions, meaning that the first variable v1 is assigned the value of the expression e1, the second variable v2 is assigned the value of the expression e2, and so on sequentially; and then the value of this let expression is the value of the expression expr. an add expression takes the form "(add e1 e2)" where add is always the string "add", there are always two expressions e1, e2 and the result is the addition of the evaluation of e1 and the evaluation of e2. a mult expression takes the form "(mult e1 e2)" where mult is always the string "mult", there are always two expressions e1, e2 and the result is the multiplication of the evaluation of e1 and the evaluation of e2. for this question, we will use a smaller subset of variable names. a variable starts with a lowercase letter, then zero or more lowercase letters or digits. additionally, for your convenience, the names "add", "let", and "mult" are protected and will never be used as variable names. finally, there is the concept of scope. when an expression of a variable name is evaluated, within the context of that evaluation, the innermost scope (in terms of parentheses) is checked first for the value of that variable, and then outer scopes are checked sequentially. it is guaranteed that every expression is legal. please see the examples for more details on the scope.

exam room there is an exam room with n seats in a single row labeled from 0 to n - 1. when a student enters the room, they must sit in the seat that maximizes the distance to the closest person. if there are multiple such seats, they sit in the seat with the lowest number. if no one is in the room, then the student sits at seat number 0. design a class that simulates the mentioned exam room. implement the examroom class: examroom(int n) initializes the object of the exam room with the number of the seats n. int seat() returns the label of the seat at which the next student will set. void leave(int p) indicates that the student sitting at seat p will leave the room. it is guaranteed that there will be a student sitting at seat p.
find winner on a tic tac toe game tic-tac-toe is played by two players a and b on a 3 x 3 grid. the rules of tic-tac-toe are: players take turns placing characters into empty squares ' '. the first player a always places 'x' characters, while the second player b always places 'o' characters. 'x' and 'o' characters are always placed into empty squares, never on filled ones. the game ends when there are three of the same (non-empty) character filling any row, column, or diagonal. the game also ends if all squares are non-empty. no more moves can be played if the game is over. given a 2d integer array moves where moves[i] = [rowi, coli] indicates that the ith move will be played on grid[rowi][coli]. return the winner of the game if it exists (a or b). in case the game ends in a draw return "draw". if there are still movements to play return "pending". you can assume that moves is valid (i.e., it follows the rules of tic-tac-toe), the grid is initially empty, and a will play first.
count unique characters of all substrings of a given string let's define a function countuniquechars(s) that returns the number of unique characters on s. for example, calling countuniquechars(s) if s = "leetcode" then "l", "t", "c", "o", "d" are the unique characters since they appear only once in s, therefore countuniquechars(s) = 5. given a string s, return the sum of countuniquechars(t) where t is a substring of s. the test cases are generated such that the answer fits in a 32-bit integer. notice that some substrings can be repeated so in this case you have to count the repeated ones too.

check if move is legal you are given a 0-indexed 8 x 8 grid board, where board[r][c] represents the cell (r, c) on a game board. on the board, free cells are represented by '.', white cells are represented by 'w', and black cells are represented by 'b'. each move in this game consists of choosing a free cell and changing it to the color you are playing as (either white or black). however, a move is only legal if, after changing it, the cell becomes the endpoint of a good line (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal). a good line is a line of three or more cells (including the endpoints) where the endpoints of the line are one color, and the remaining cells in the middle are the opposite color (no cells in the line are free). you can find examples for good lines in the figure below: given two integers rmove and cmove and a character color representing the color you are playing as (white or black), return true if changing cell (rmove, cmove) to color color is a legal move, or false if it is not legal.
swap adjacent in lr string in a string composed of 'l', 'r', and 'x' characters, like "rxxlrxrxl", a move consists of either replacing one occurrence of "xl" with "lx", or replacing one occurrence of "rx" with "xr". given the starting string start and the ending string end, return true if and only if there exists a sequence of moves to transform one string to the other.
count of matches in tournament you are given an integer n, the number of teams in a tournament that has strange rules: if the current number of teams is even, each team gets paired with another team. a total of n / 2 matches are played, and n / 2 teams advance to the next round. if the current number of teams is odd, one team randomly advances in the tournament, and the rest gets paired. a total of (n - 1) / 2 matches are played, and (n - 1) / 2 + 1 teams advance to the next round. return the number of matches played in the tournament until a winner is decided.
determine if two strings are close two strings are considered close if you can attain one from the other using the following operations: operation 1: swap any two existing characters. for example, abcde -> aecdb operation 2: transform every occurrence of one existing character into another existing character, and do the same with the other character. for example, aacabb -> bbcbaa (all a's turn into b's, and all b's turn into a's) you can use the operations on either string as many times as necessary. given two strings, word1 and word2, return true if word1 and word2 are close, and false otherwise.

minimize the maximum difference of pairs you are given a 0-indexed integer array nums and an integer p. find p pairs of indices of nums such that the maximum difference amongst all the pairs is minimized. also, ensure no index appears more than once amongst the p pairs. note that for a pair of elements at the index i and j, the difference of this pair is |nums[i] - nums[j]|, where |x| represents the absolute value of x. return the minimum maximum difference among all p pairs. we define the maximum of an empty set to be zero.
count unhappy friends you are given a list of preferences for n friends, where n is always even. for each person i, preferences[i] contains a list of friends sorted in the order of preference. in other words, a friend earlier in the list is more preferred than a friend later in the list. friends in each list are denoted by integers from 0 to n-1. all the friends are divided into pairs. the pairings are given in a list pairs, where pairs[i] = [xi, yi] denotes xi is paired with yi and yi is paired with xi. however, this pairing may cause some of the friends to be unhappy. a friend x is unhappy if x is paired with y and there exists a friend u who is paired with v but: x prefers u over y, and u prefers x over v. return the number of unhappy friends.
count hills and valleys in an array you are given a 0-indexed integer array nums. an index i is part of a hill in nums if the closest non-equal neighbors of i are smaller than nums[i]. similarly, an index i is part of a valley in nums if the closest non-equal neighbors of i are larger than nums[i]. adjacent indices i and j are part of the same hill or valley if nums[i] == nums[j]. note that for an index to be part of a hill or valley, it must have a non-equal neighbor on both the left and right of the index. return the number of hills and valleys in nums.
count distinct numbers on board you are given a positive integer n, that is initially placed on a board. every day, for 109 days, you perform the following procedure: for each number x present on the board, find all numbers 1 <= i <= n such that x % i == 1. then, place those numbers on the board. return the number of distinct integers present on the board after 109 days have elapsed. note: once a number is placed on the board, it will remain on it until the end. % stands for the modulo operation. for example, 14 % 3 is 2.
count number of texts alice is texting bob using her phone. the mapping of digits to letters is shown in the figure below. in order to add a letter, alice has to press the key of the corresponding digit i times, where i is the position of the letter in the key. for example, to add the letter 's', alice has to press '7' four times. similarly, to add the letter 'k', alice has to press '5' twice. note that the digits '0' and '1' do not map to any letters, so alice does not use them. however, due to an error in transmission, bob did not receive alice's text message but received a string of pressed keys instead. for example, when alice sent the message "bob", bob received the string "2266622". given a string pressedkeys representing the string received by bob, return the total number of possible text messages alice could have sent. since the answer may be very large, return it modulo 109 + 7.
abbreviating the product of a range you are given two positive integers left and right with left <= right. calculate the product of all integers in the inclusive range [left, right]. since the product may be very large, you will abbreviate it following these steps: count all trailing zeros in the product and remove them. let us denote this count as c. for example, there are 3 trailing zeros in 1000, and there are 0 trailing zeros in 546. denote the remaining number of digits in the product as d. if d > 10, then express the product as <pre>...<suf> where <pre> denotes the first 5 digits of the product, and <suf> denotes the last 5 digits of the product after removing all trailing zeros. if d <= 10, we keep it unchanged. for example, we express 1234567654321 as 12345...54321, but 1234567 is represented as 1234567. finally, represent the product as a string "<pre>...<suf>ec". for example, 12345678987600000 will be represented as "12345...89876e5". return a string denoting the abbreviated product of all integers in the inclusive range [left, right].
minimum incompatibility you are given an integer array nums and an integer k. you are asked to distribute this array into k subsets of equal size such that there are no two equal elements in the same subset. a subset's incompatibility is the difference between the maximum and minimum elements in that array. return the minimum possible sum of incompatibilities of the k subsets after distributing the array optimally, or return -1 if it is not possible. a subset is a group integers that appear in the array with no particular order.
remove outermost parentheses a valid parentheses string is either empty "", "(" + a + ")", or a + b, where a and b are valid parentheses strings, and + represents string concatenation. for example, "", "()", "(())()", and "(()(()))" are all valid parentheses strings. a valid parentheses string s is primitive if it is nonempty, and there does not exist a way to split it into s = a + b, with a and b nonempty valid parentheses strings. given a valid parentheses string s, consider its primitive decomposition: s = p1 + p2 + ... + pk, where pi are primitive valid parentheses strings. return s after removing the outermost parentheses of every primitive string in the primitive decomposition of s.
zuma game you are playing a variation of the game zuma. in this variation of zuma, there is a single row of colored balls on a board, where each ball can be colored red 'r', yellow 'y', blue 'b', green 'g', or white 'w'. you also have several colored balls in your hand. your goal is to clear all of the balls from the board. on each turn: pick any ball from your hand and insert it in between two balls in the row or on either end of the row. if there is a group of three or more consecutive balls of the same color, remove the group of balls from the board. if this removal causes more groups of three or more of the same color to form, then continue removing each group until there are none left. if there are no more balls on the board, then you win the game. repeat this process until you either win or do not have any more balls in your hand. given a string board, representing the row of balls on the board, and a string hand, representing the balls in your hand, return the minimum number of balls you have to insert to clear all the balls from the board. if you cannot clear all the balls from the board using the balls in your hand, return -1.

insert delete getrandom o(1) - duplicates allowed randomizedcollection is a data structure that contains a collection of numbers, possibly duplicates (i.e., a multiset). it should support inserting and removing specific elements and also reporting a random element. implement the randomizedcollection class: randomizedcollection() initializes the empty randomizedcollection object. bool insert(int val) inserts an item val into the multiset, even if the item is already present. returns true if the item is not present, false otherwise. bool remove(int val) removes an item val from the multiset if present. returns true if the item is present, false otherwise. note that if val has multiple occurrences in the multiset, we only remove one of them. int getrandom() returns a random element from the current multiset of elements. the probability of each element being returned is linearly related to the number of the same values the multiset contains. you must implement the functions of the class such that each function works on average o(1) time complexity. note: the test cases are generated such that getrandom will only be called if there is at least one item in the randomizedcollection.
partition array according to given pivot you are given a 0-indexed integer array nums and an integer pivot. rearrange nums such that the following conditions are satisfied: every element less than pivot appears before every element greater than pivot. every element equal to pivot appears in between the elements less than and greater than pivot. the relative order of the elements less than pivot and the elements greater than pivot is maintained. more formally, consider every pi, pj where pi is the new position of the ith element and pj is the new position of the jth element. for elements less than pivot, if i < j and nums[i] < pivot and nums[j] < pivot, then pi < pj. similarly for elements greater than pivot, if i < j and nums[i] > pivot and nums[j] > pivot, then pi < pj. return nums after the rearrangement.

"acdbef" is not a concatenated substring because it is not the concatenation of any permutation of words. return the starting indices of all the concatenated substrings in s. you can return the answer in any order.

the dining philosophers five silent philosophers sit at a round table with bowls of spaghetti. forks are placed between each pair of adjacent philosophers. each philosopher must alternately think and eat. however, a philosopher can only eat spaghetti when they have both left and right forks. each fork can be held by only one philosopher and so a philosopher can use the fork only if it is not being used by another philosopher. after an individual philosopher finishes eating, they need to put down both forks so that the forks become available to others. a philosopher can take the fork on their right or the one on their left as they become available, but cannot start eating before getting both forks. eating is not limited by the remaining amounts of spaghetti or stomach space; an infinite supply and an infinite demand are assumed. design a discipline of behaviour (a concurrent algorithm) such that no philosopher will starve; i.e., each can forever continue to alternate between eating and thinking, assuming that no philosopher can know when others may want to eat or think. the problem statement and the image above are taken from wikipedia.org the philosophers' ids are numbered from 0 to 4 in a clockwise order. implement the function void wantstoeat(philosopher, pickleftfork, pickrightfork, eat, putleftfork, putrightfork) where: philosopher is the id of the philosopher who wants to eat. pickleftfork and pickrightfork are functions you can call to pick the corresponding forks of that philosopher. eat is a function you can call to let the philosopher eat once he has picked both forks. putleftfork and putrightfork are functions you can call to put down the corresponding forks of that philosopher. the philosophers are assumed to be thinking as long as they are not asking to eat (the function is not being called with their number). five threads, each representing a philosopher, will simultaneously use one object of your class to simulate the process. the function may be called for the same philosopher more than once, even before the last call ends.

game of life according to wikipedia's article: "the game of life, also known simply as life, is a cellular automaton devised by the british mathematician john horton conway in 1970." the board is made up of an m x n grid of cells, where each cell has an initial state: live (represented by a 1) or dead (represented by a 0). each cell interacts with its eight neighbors (horizontal, vertical, diagonal) using the following four rules (taken from the above wikipedia article): any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies as if caused by under-population. any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation. any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by over-population. any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction. the next state is created by applying the above rules simultaneously to every cell in the current state, where births and deaths occur simultaneously. given the current state of the m x n grid board, return the next state.
count pairs of nodes you are given an undirected graph defined by an integer n, the number of nodes, and a 2d integer array edges, the edges in the graph, where edges[i] = [ui, vi] indicates that there is an undirected edge between ui and vi. you are also given an integer array queries. let incident(a, b) be defined as the number of edges that are connected to either node a or b. the answer to the jth query is the number of pairs of nodes (a, b) that satisfy both of the following conditions: a < b incident(a, b) > queries[j] return an array answers such that answers.length == queries.length and answers[j] is the answer of the jth query. note that there can be multiple edges between the same two nodes.

new 21 game alice plays the following game, loosely based on the card game "21". alice starts with 0 points and draws numbers while she has less than k points. during each draw, she gains an integer number of points randomly from the range [1, maxpts], where maxpts is an integer. each draw is independent and the outcomes have equal probabilities. alice stops drawing numbers when she gets k or more points. return the probability that alice has n or fewer points. answers within 10-5 of the actual answer are considered accepted.
minimum cost to cut a stick given a wooden stick of length n units. the stick is labelled from 0 to n. for example, a stick of length 6 is labelled as follows: given an integer array cuts where cuts[i] denotes a position you should perform a cut at. you should perform the cuts in order, you can change the order of the cuts as you wish. the cost of one cut is the length of the stick to be cut, the total cost is the sum of costs of all cuts. when you cut a stick, it will be split into two smaller sticks (i.e. the sum of their lengths is the length of the stick before the cut). please refer to the first example for a better explanation. return the minimum total cost of the cuts.
kth smallest instructions bob is standing at cell (0, 0), and he wants to reach destination: (row, column). he can only travel right and down. you are going to help bob by providing instructions for him to reach destination. the instructions are represented as a string, where each character is either: 'h', meaning move horizontally (go right), or 'v', meaning move vertically (go down). multiple instructions will lead bob to destination. for example, if destination is (2, 3), both "hhhvv" and "hvhvh" are valid instructions. however, bob is very picky. bob has a lucky number k, and he wants the kth lexicographically smallest instructions that will lead him to destination. k is 1-indexed. given an integer array destination and an integer k, return the kth lexicographically smallest instructions that will take bob to destination.
ambiguous coordinates we had some 2-dimensional coordinates, like "(1, 3)" or "(2, 0.5)". then, we removed all commas, decimal points, and spaces and ended up with the string s. for example, "(1, 3)" becomes s = "(13)" and "(2, 0.5)" becomes s = "(205)". return a list of strings representing all possibilities for what our original coordinates could have been. our original representation never had extraneous zeroes, so we never started with numbers like "00", "0.0", "0.00", "1.0", "001", "00.01", or any other number that can be represented with fewer digits. also, a decimal point within a number never occurs without at least one digit occurring before it, so we never started with numbers like ".1". the final answer list can be returned in any order. all coordinates in the final answer have exactly one space between them (occurring after the comma.)
calculate delayed arrival time you are given a positive integer arrivaltime denoting the arrival time of a train in hours, and another positive integer delayedtime denoting the amount of delay in hours. return the time when the train will arrive at the station. note that the time in this problem is in 24-hours format.
count palindromic subsequences given a string of digits s, return the number of palindromic subsequences of s having length 5. since the answer may be very large, return it modulo 109 + 7. note: a string is palindromic if it reads the same forward and backward. a subsequence is a string that can be derived from another string by deleting some or no characters without changing the order of the remaining characters.
reformat the string you are given an alphanumeric string s. (alphanumeric string is a string consisting of lowercase english letters and digits). you have to find a permutation of the string where no letter is followed by another letter and no digit is followed by another digit. that is, no two adjacent characters have the same type. return the reformatted string or return an empty string if it is impossible to reformat the string.
building h2o there are two kinds of threads: oxygen and hydrogen. your goal is to group these threads to form water molecules. there is a barrier where each thread has to wait until a complete molecule can be formed. hydrogen and oxygen threads will be given releasehydrogen and releaseoxygen methods respectively, which will allow them to pass the barrier. these threads should pass the barrier in groups of three, and they must immediately bond with each other to form a water molecule. you must guarantee that all the threads from one molecule bond before any other threads from the next molecule do. in other words: if an oxygen thread arrives at the barrier when no hydrogen threads are present, it must wait for two hydrogen threads. if a hydrogen thread arrives at the barrier when no other threads are present, it must wait for an oxygen thread and another hydrogen thread. we do not have to worry about matching the threads up explicitly; the threads do not necessarily know which other threads they are paired up with. the key is that threads pass the barriers in complete sets; thus, if we examine the sequence of threads that bind and divide them into groups of three, each group should contain one oxygen and two hydrogen threads. write synchronization code for oxygen and hydrogen molecules that enforces these constraints.
smallest number in infinite set you have a set which contains all positive integers [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ...]. implement the smallestinfiniteset class: smallestinfiniteset() initializes the smallestinfiniteset object to contain all positive integers. int popsmallest() removes and returns the smallest integer contained in the infinite set. void addback(int num) adds a positive integer num back into the infinite set, if it is not already in the infinite set.
leaf-similar trees consider all the leaves of a binary tree, from left to right order, the values of those leaves form a leaf value sequence. for example, in the given tree above, the leaf value sequence is (6, 7, 4, 9, 8). two binary trees are considered leaf-similar if their leaf value sequence is the same. return true if and only if the two given trees with head nodes root1 and root2 are leaf-similar.
image overlap you are given two images, img1 and img2, represented as binary, square matrices of size n x n. a binary matrix has only 0s and 1s as values. we translate one image however we choose by sliding all the 1 bits left, right, up, and/or down any number of units. we then place it on top of the other image. we can then calculate the overlap by counting the number of positions that have a 1 in both images. note also that a translation does not include any kind of rotation. any 1 bits that are translated outside of the matrix borders are erased. return the largest possible overlap.
average selling price sql schema table: prices +---------------+---------+ | column name | type | +---------------+---------+ | product_id | int | | start_date | date | | end_date | date | | price | int | +---------------+---------+ (product_id, start_date, end_date) is the primary key for this table. each row of this table indicates the price of the product_id in the period from start_date to end_date. for each product_id there will be no two overlapping periods. that means there will be no two intersecting periods for the same product_id. table: unitssold +---------------+---------+ | column name | type | +---------------+---------+ | product_id | int | | purchase_date | date | | units | int | +---------------+---------+ there is no primary key for this table, it may contain duplicates. each row of this table indicates the date, units, and product_id of each product sold. write an sql query to find the average selling price for each product. average_price should be rounded to 2 decimal places. return the result table in any order. the query result format is in the following example.

check if one string swap can make strings equal you are given two strings s1 and s2 of equal length. a string swap is an operation where you choose two indices in a string (not necessarily different) and swap the characters at these indices. return true if it is possible to make both strings equal by performing at most one string swap on exactly one of the strings. otherwise, return false.
smallest value after replacing with sum of prime factors you are given a positive integer n. continuously replace n with the sum of its prime factors. note that if a prime factor divides n multiple times, it should be included in the sum as many times as it divides n. return the smallest value n will take on.
unique length-3 palindromic subsequences given a string s, return the number of unique palindromes of length three that are a subsequence of s. note that even if there are multiple ways to obtain the same subsequence, it is still only counted once. a palindrome is a string that reads the same forwards and backwards. a subsequence of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters (can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters. for example, "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde".
duplicate zeros given a fixed-length integer array arr, duplicate each occurrence of zero, shifting the remaining elements to the right. note that elements beyond the length of the original array are not written. do the above modifications to the input array in place and do not return anything.

binary search tree to greater sum tree given the root of a binary search tree (bst), convert it to a greater tree such that every key of the original bst is changed to the original key plus the sum of all keys greater than the original key in bst. as a reminder, a binary search tree is a tree that satisfies these constraints: the left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key. the right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key. both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.
count unreachable pairs of nodes in an undirected graph you are given an integer n. there is an undirected graph with n nodes, numbered from 0 to n - 1. you are given a 2d integer array edges where edges[i] = [ai, bi] denotes that there exists an undirected edge connecting nodes ai and bi. return the number of pairs of different nodes that are unreachable from each other.

design an atm machine there is an atm machine that stores banknotes of 5 denominations: 20, 50, 100, 200, and 500 dollars. initially the atm is empty. the user can use the machine to deposit or withdraw any amount of money. when withdrawing, the machine prioritizes using banknotes of larger values. for example, if you want to withdraw $300 and there are 2 $50 banknotes, 1 $100 banknote, and 1 $200 banknote, then the machine will use the $100 and $200 banknotes. however, if you try to withdraw $600 and there are 3 $200 banknotes and 1 $500 banknote, then the withdraw request will be rejected because the machine will first try to use the $500 banknote and then be unable to use banknotes to complete the remaining $100. note that the machine is not allowed to use the $200 banknotes instead of the $500 banknote. implement the atm class: atm() initializes the atm object. void deposit(int[] banknotescount) deposits new banknotes in the order $20, $50, $100, $200, and $500. int[] withdraw(int amount) returns an array of length 5 of the number of banknotes that will be handed to the user in the order $20, $50, $100, $200, and $500, and update the number of banknotes in the atm after withdrawing. returns [-1] if it is not possible (do not withdraw any banknotes in this case).
number of ways to reconstruct a tree you are given an array pairs, where pairs[i] = [xi, yi], and: there are no duplicates. xi < yi let ways be the number of rooted trees that satisfy the following conditions: the tree consists of nodes whose values appeared in pairs. a pair [xi, yi] exists in pairs if and only if xi is an ancestor of yi or yi is an ancestor of xi. note: the tree does not have to be a binary tree. two ways are considered to be different if there is at least one node that has different parents in both ways. return: 0 if ways == 0 1 if ways == 1 2 if ways > 1 a rooted tree is a tree that has a single root node, and all edges are oriented to be outgoing from the root. an ancestor of a node is any node on the path from the root to that node (excluding the node itself). the root has no ancestors.
implement trie (prefix tree) a trie (pronounced as "try") or prefix tree is a tree data structure used to efficiently store and retrieve keys in a dataset of strings. there are various applications of this data structure, such as autocomplete and spellchecker. implement the trie class: trie() initializes the trie object. void insert(string word) inserts the string word into the trie. boolean search(string word) returns true if the string word is in the trie (i.e., was inserted before), and false otherwise. boolean startswith(string prefix) returns true if there is a previously inserted string word that has the prefix prefix, and false otherwise.
pancake sorting given an array of integers arr, sort the array by performing a series of pancake flips. in one pancake flip we do the following steps: choose an integer k where 1 <= k <= arr.length. reverse the sub-array arr[0...k-1] (0-indexed). for example, if arr = [3,2,1,4] and we performed a pancake flip choosing k = 3, we reverse the sub-array [3,2,1], so arr = [1,2,3,4] after the pancake flip at k = 3. return an array of the k-values corresponding to a sequence of pancake flips that sort arr. any valid answer that sorts the array within 10 * arr.length flips will be judged as correct.

delete duplicate folders in system due to a bug, there are many duplicate folders in a file system. you are given a 2d array paths, where paths[i] is an array representing an absolute path to the ith folder in the file system. for example, ["one", "two", "three"] represents the path "/one/two/three". two folders (not necessarily on the same level) are identical if they contain the same non-empty set of identical subfolders and underlying subfolder structure. the folders do not need to be at the root level to be identical. if two or more folders are identical, then mark the folders as well as all their subfolders. for example, folders "/a" and "/b" in the file structure below are identical. they (as well as their subfolders) should all be marked: /a /a/x /a/x/y /a/z /b /b/x /b/x/y /b/z however, if the file structure also included the path "/b/w", then the folders "/a" and "/b" would not be identical. note that "/a/x" and "/b/x" would still be considered identical even with the added folder. once all the identical folders and their subfolders have been marked, the file system will delete all of them. the file system only runs the deletion once, so any folders that become identical after the initial deletion are not deleted. return the 2d array ans containing the paths of the remaining folders after deleting all the marked folders. the paths may be returned in any order.
decode the slanted ciphertext a string originaltext is encoded using a slanted transposition cipher to a string encodedtext with the help of a matrix having a fixed number of rows rows. originaltext is placed first in a top-left to bottom-right manner. the blue cells are filled first, followed by the red cells, then the yellow cells, and so on, until we reach the end of originaltext. the arrow indicates the order in which the cells are filled. all empty cells are filled with ' '. the number of columns is chosen such that the rightmost column will not be empty after filling in originaltext. encodedtext is then formed by appending all characters of the matrix in a row-wise fashion. the characters in the blue cells are appended first to encodedtext, then the red cells, and so on, and finally the yellow cells. the arrow indicates the order in which the cells are accessed. for example, if originaltext = "cipher" and rows = 3, then we encode it in the following manner: the blue arrows depict how originaltext is placed in the matrix, and the red arrows denote the order in which encodedtext is formed. in the above example, encodedtext = "ch ie pr". given the encoded string encodedtext and number of rows rows, return the original string originaltext. note: originaltext does not have any trailing spaces ' '. the test cases are generated such that there is only one possible originaltext.

tag validator given a string representing a code snippet, implement a tag validator to parse the code and return whether it is valid. a code snippet is valid if all the following rules hold: the code must be wrapped in a valid closed tag. otherwise, the code is invalid. a closed tag (not necessarily valid) has exactly the following format : <tag_name>tag_content</tag_name>. among them, <tag_name> is the start tag, and </tag_name> is the end tag. the tag_name in start and end tags should be the same. a closed tag is valid if and only if the tag_name and tag_content are valid. a valid tag_name only contain upper-case letters, and has length in range [1,9]. otherwise, the tag_name is invalid. a valid tag_content may contain other valid closed tags, cdata and any characters (see note1) except unmatched <, unmatched start and end tag, and unmatched or closed tags with invalid tag_name. otherwise, the tag_content is invalid. a start tag is unmatched if no end tag exists with the same tag_name, and vice versa. however, you also need to consider the issue of unbalanced when tags are nested. a < is unmatched if you cannot find a subsequent >. and when you find a < or </, all the subsequent characters until the next > should be parsed as tag_name (not necessarily valid). the cdata has the following format : <![cdata[cdata_content]]>. the range of cdata_content is defined as the characters between <![cdata[ and the first subsequent ]]>. cdata_content may contain any characters. the function of cdata is to forbid the validator to parse cdata_content, so even it has some characters that can be parsed as tag (no matter valid or invalid), you should treat it as regular characters.
optimal division you are given an integer array nums. the adjacent integers in nums will perform the float division. for example, for nums = [2,3,4], we will evaluate the expression "2/3/4". however, you can add any number of parenthesis at any position to change the priority of operations. you want to add these parentheses such the value of the expression after the evaluation is maximum. return the corresponding expression that has the maximum value in string format. note: your expression should not contain redundant parenthesis.

design cancellable function sometimes you have a long running task, and you may wish to cancel it before it completes. to help with this goal, write a function cancellable that accepts a generator object and returns an array of two values: a cancel function and a promise. you may assume the generator function will only yield promises. it is your function's responsibility to pass the values resolved by the promise back to the generator. if the promise rejects, your function should throw that error back to the generator. if the cancel callback is called before the generator is done, your function should throw an error back to the generator. that error should be the string "cancelled" (not an error object). if the error was caught, the returned promise should resolve with the next value that was yielded or returned. otherwise, the promise should reject with the thrown error. no more code should be executed. when the generator is done, the promise your function returned should resolve the value the generator returned. if, however, the generator throws an error, the returned promise should reject with the error. an example of how your code would be used: function* tasks() { const val = yield new promise(resolve => resolve(2 + 2)); yield new promise(resolve => settimeout(resolve, 100)); return val + 1; // calculation shouldn't be done. } const [cancel, promise] = cancellable(tasks()); settimeout(cancel, 50); promise.catch(console.log); // logs "cancelled" at t=50ms if instead cancel() was not called or was called after t=100ms, the promise would have resolved 5.

string to integer (atoi) implement the myatoi(string s) function, which converts a string to a 32-bit signed integer (similar to c/c++'s atoi function). the algorithm for myatoi(string s) is as follows: read in and ignore any leading whitespace. check if the next character (if not already at the end of the string) is '-' or '+'. read this character in if it is either. this determines if the final result is negative or positive respectively. assume the result is positive if neither is present. read in next the characters until the next non-digit character or the end of the input is reached. the rest of the string is ignored. convert these digits into an integer (i.e. "123" -> 123, "0032" -> 32). if no digits were read, then the integer is 0. change the sign as necessary (from step 2). if the integer is out of the 32-bit signed integer range [-231, 231 - 1], then clamp the integer so that it remains in the range. specifically, integers less than -231 should be clamped to -231, and integers greater than 231 - 1 should be clamped to 231 - 1. return the integer as the final result. note: only the space character ' ' is considered a whitespace character. do not ignore any characters other than the leading whitespace or the rest of the string after the digits.
